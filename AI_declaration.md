# Declaration on the Use of AI Tools

As part of this project, I used several artificial intelligence tools as **support** tools during the development process.

In particular, **ChatGPT**, **Perplexity**, **Gemnini** and **GitHub Copilot** were used to:
- help structure the project and clarify the overall architecture,
- assist with explanations of concepts related to machine learning and inventory management,
- support debugging and problem-solving during the coding process by helping identify errors and suggesting possible improvement,
- improve the clarity, structure, and academic tone of written documentation and presentations,
- support code readability and organization.

All core ideas, design choices, implementation decisions and final coding were **understood, reviewed, and validated by me**.  
The AI tools were used as assistants and did not replace my own reasoning, coding, or decision-making.

The final project reflects my own work and understanding of the subject and I take full responsibility for its content.
